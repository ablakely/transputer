The files contained in this folder are used for building the Arduino sketch.

It uses the Ino (http://inotool.org/) toolset to build and compile the sketch, as well
as flash it to the board.

PLEASE NOTE: That not all sensors may act the same way, therefore readings may differ
             between sensors.  You might need to tweak the code/equations to produce
             accurate readings with you're setup.

Building:
	It's as simple as running: make

Flashing to the Arduino:
	To do this is a little bit different.  You need to figure out which /dev/tty* device
	you're Arduino is.  (Usually will be either /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyAMC0 depending on model.)

	Once you've located your device, simply do this:
		ARDUINOTTY=/dev/ttyUSB0; make install

	This should flash the sketch to the arduino's EPROM.  Once that is done you're arduino is
	ready to be used as a transputer hardware interface. :)
